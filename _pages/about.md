I am a Ph.D. student in the [Seed Science and Technology Research Group](seedbiology.de) 
at [Royal Holloway, University of London](https://royalholloway.ac.uk). I am studying the effects 
of soil microbiological communities on the longevity of blackgrass (*Alopecurus myosuroides*) 
seeds in the soil seedbank. My studies are funded by the 
[London Interdisciplinary Biosciences Consortium Doctoral Training Partnership](https://www.lido-dtp.ac.uk/)
 with Syngenta supporting as an industry partner.

I earned my M.S. in Agronomy from the
[Pennsylvania State University](https://agsci.psu.edu/) and my B.A. in Environmental Science from 
[Vassar College](https://www.vassar.edu). I have broad interests in agriculture and international 
agricultural development.
